    abstract = {Artificial intelligence has emerged as promising tool to decode an image transmitted through a multimode fiber (MMF) by applying deep learning techniques. By transmitting thousands of images through the MMF, deep neural networks (DNNs) are able to decipher the seemingly random output speckle patterns and unveil the intrinsic input-output relationship. High fidelity reconstruction is obtained for datasets with a large degree of homogeneity, which underutilizes the capacity of the combined MMF-DNN system. Here, we show that holographic modulation can encode an additional layer of variance on the output speckle pattern, improving the overall transmissive capabilities of the system. Operatively, we have implemented this by adding a holographic label to the original dataset and injecting the resulting phase image into the fiber facet through a Fourier transform lens. The resulting speckle pattern dataset can be clustered primarily by holographic label, and can be reconstructed without loss of fidelity. As an application, we describe how color images may be segmented into RGB components and each color component may then be labelled by distinct hologram. A ResUNet architecture was then used to decode each class of speckle patterns and reconstruct the color image without the need for temporal synchronization between sender and receiver.}
